    </div> <span><span className="font-extrabold">Make the crust:</span>Using a food processor, 
    pulse the graham crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir
     in sugar and melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the food processor.) 
     Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch
      springform pan. No need to grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crust down
       tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil.
        The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4.
     Allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</span>

    </div><span><span className="font-extrabold">Make the filling:</span> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, 
    beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture
     is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract, and lemon juice
      then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time, beating after
       each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter,
        stop mixing. To help prevent the 
    cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools, avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.</span>

    </div><span><span className="font-extrabold">Prepare the simple water bath
     (see note)</span> Boil a pot of water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting
      pan for the water bath, so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water.
       As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the 
       cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer.
        Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water
         inside of the pan and place in the oven.
     (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)</span>

       When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble 
       if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. 
       Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. 
       Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature.
        Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.</span>
